## The Problem: Unmanaged Growth and Technical Debt

In the absence of a structured framework, a Salesforce org can accumulate technical debt and succumb to "org bloat," which refers to an environment that is difficult to manage and scale due to inconsistent or unorganized customizations. When multiple teams, developers, and administrators implement changes without a common set of rules, the platform becomes a liability rather than a flexible tool. This unmanaged growth leads to a chaotic state where maintenance is challenging, new feature development is slow, and the risk of unexpected behavior or data integrity issues is high.

## The Solution: A Governance Model

A robust governance model is the solution to unmanaged growth, providing a structured framework for organizing and overseeing the use and development of the Salesforce environment. A strong governance model is composed of three core pillars: People, Process, and Technology. This guide provides a critical component of both the "Process" and "Technology" pillars, offering the specific, actionable standards and rules for development.

The most effective governance models are supported by a Governance Council or Steering Committee and a Center of Excellence (CoE). The Governance Council makes high-level strategic decisions, while the CoE provides the hands-on expertise and guidance on best practices. For this guide to have a lasting impact, its principles and standards must be formally adopted by these governance bodies and integrated into the project's operational processes.

## The Guiding Principles: Salesforce Well-Architected Framework

All development standards outlined in this guide are anchored in the Salesforce Well-Architected Framework, which provides the authoritative, industry-standard principles for building healthy solutions on the Customer 360 Platform. Adherence to these principles elevates the conversation from simple code-level rules to a focus on long-term architectural health. The framework is structured around three core capabilities:

- Trusted: This capability is concerned with protecting the business and its stakeholders. A trusted solution is one that is secure, compliant, and reliable. The standards presented here, such as governor limit management and bulkification, are essential for ensuring a reliable solution that can handle high-volume operations without failure.
- Easy: An easy solution delivers business value quickly and can be easily managed over time. This includes focusing on intentional design, maintainability, and readability. The prescriptive naming conventions and consistent code style guides in this document directly support the "Easy" principle by making the codebase intuitive and straightforward to maintain for any developer or administrator.
- Adaptable: Adaptability ensures that a solution can evolve with the changing needs of the business. This is achieved through resilience and composability. Modern trigger frameworks and modular flow designs, as detailed in the following sections, are key examples of standards that promote adaptability by supporting separation of concerns and packageability.

Every standard within this guide is tied to one or more of these core principles. By understanding this connection, a project team can move beyond simply following rules to thinking architecturally. A decision to adopt a specific naming convention or a particular trigger framework is no longer a micro-level choice but a strategic one that contributes directly to the long-term health, security, and scalability of the entire platform.
